# ApeBoardScraper 

ApeBoardScraper is a simple tool that takes the local path to your exported apeboard.finance data, and returns a weighted average based on that asset's change in price over the past week. This project can be easily expanded to offer other indicators using Coinstat's api in conjunction with Apeboard.finance.
